# CyberSecurity
In this course we have learned about security issues in common communication protocols, as well as algorithms used to secure local, mobile and Internet communication networks.

We also studied types of algorithms that were created in order to achieve specific goals related to information security, concentrating on information transferring over the network.

This course provided a great deal of knowledge about security problems in communication networks, including the solutions of the problems. We have studed that through lectures and exercises that implement tools to exploit vulnerabilities or protect against them.
