# CyberSecurity
In this course we learned about security issues in common communication protocols, as well as algorithms used to secure local, mobile and Internet communication networks.

We also knew the types of algorithms that were created to achieve specific goals related to information security by concentrating on information passing over a communication network.

This course provided a great deal of knowledge about security problems in communication networks and protocols and the solution of the problems, through lectures and exercises that implement tools to exploit loopholes or protect against them.
